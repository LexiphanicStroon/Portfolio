<div class="about">
    <p>I worked for seven years in the construction industry, travelling often and learning a lot.<br>
    It wasn't what I wanted to do forever, and Computer Science was my strongest subject in high school,<br><br>
    However, I learned a lot from the trades.  How important strong communication is, performing well under stress,<br>
    working long hours, and the list goes on. My experience is invaluable, and I don't regret it in the slightest.
    <br>I took a huge leap when I decided to change careers, and enrolled in Web Development with Robertson College.<br><br>
    I studied hard, and graduated with honours with no prior experience with higher learning.<br>
    I think the most important thing a student of development can learn, is HOW to learn.
<br><br>
Above all, being able to solve problems, and adapt to new environments are the most important lessons I've learned.
