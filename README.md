It contains links to view projects I have made during my college education in Full Stack Web Development.

I plan to write out thoruough documentation for all three projects, for now they are presented in video format for you to look over.

Three distinct web apps made to show off their functionality.

I have not spent any time to make them look pretty, the importance here is the functionality, namely databases that seed upon command, that are easy to update with no working knowledge of databases. There is much deeper functionality than explained in the videos, but for brevity's sake, I didn't go into it all. If you have any questions about more of the behind the scenes I'd be happy to elaborate.
