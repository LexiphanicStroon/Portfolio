Three distinct web apps made to show off their functionality.

I have not spent any time to make them look pretty, the importance here is the functionality, namely databases that seed upon command, that are easy to update with no working knowledge of databases.

If you have any questions about more of the behind the scenes I'd be happy to elaborate.
