        <h1>WordPress Developer</h1>
        <p>
            In order to complete my college diploma, I interned with a design studio called Chez Koop.<br>
            Here I learned to program in PHP, developing custom WordPress themes that could be used for a<br>
            company's website.

        <h1>UI Designer/Team Lead</h1>
        <p>
            I'm currently employed by a tech startup called My Little Tribe.<br>
            My job is to communicate back and forth between the dev team, and the owner<br>
            to ensure deadlines are met.<br>
            I'm also in charge of designing and implementing the UI.<br>
            I like to focus on a non-intrusive user experience, and keeping the web accessible,<br>
            for those using screen readers that use the web.

            make it responsive to any screen size, and keep it search engine optimized.
